# Portfolio Template

## Get started
- Fork this repo, using the fork button in the upper right hand corner
- Clone down forked repo to your local machine using `git clone` + the repo url. Be sure to `cd` into the folder where you want this project to live first.

## Customize
- There has been an initial layout created and some styling added to get you started, but feel free to add and remove sections based on your own experiences and projects.
- Commit your changes and push up to the remote repo using `git push origin` + branch name.
- Open the index.html file in the browser to see your changes, refreshing after each update. 

## Basic Git Workflow
- Once you have made edits that you are ready to commit, in your terminal type `git add <file_name>` or `git add .` for all edited files
- Type `git status` to see the files that have been staged, which should be in green
- Type `git commit -m "commit message"` to commit your changes with a message. Convention is to keep these messages in present tense, for example, "Change heading color"
- Ready to push to your remote repo? Type `git push origin <branch>`
- **Note** - typically we don't work from our main branch or release branch when working on teams and conducting code review. For the sake of this project, feel free to since stakes are low and you can skip the code review process for this practice assignment!

## Deploy to GitHub Pages
Go to Settings on the repo page --> Github Pages --> In Source section update branch to main and save:
